# Zoo Animal and Employee Tracker Using TypeScript and OOP

The Zoo Animal and Employee Tracker is an interactive application designed to efficiently manage and track zoo animals and employees. Leveraging TypeScript, the project incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a scalable, maintainable, and robust system. By using TypeScriptâ€™s static typing, the application ensures fewer runtime errors, allowing for smoother operations and a more reliable experience.

## User Story

```md
As a developer, I want a robust and less error prone application built using TypeScript that will take in user input via Inquirer.js on the different animals living and employees working at the zoo.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
As a developer, I want to follow the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm to build a modular, reuseable system for future development cycles.
```

## Key Features

**Animal Tracking:** Allows the addition, removal, and categorization of different zoo animals, providing detailed information such as species, age, and health status. Users can also track feeding schedules and medical history.

---

**Employee Management:** Manages employee data, including roles, schedules, and performance metrics. Employees' tasks and responsibilities are linked to specific animal care activities, ensuring seamless operation within the zoo.

---

**Type Safety:** The use of TypeScript ensures that variables and objects have defined types, minimizing the risk of errors in the application and improving maintainability.

---

**Data Relationships:** The system establishes relationships between animals and employees, helping zoo staff track which employees are responsible for which animals and tasks.

---

**OOP Structure:** The application follows an object-oriented approach, creating classes for animals, employees, tasks, and schedules, promoting modularity and reusability of code.


## Technology Stack:

**TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and better error detection during development.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Promotes a clean, scalable design by using classes, interfaces, inheritance, and encapsulation.

---

**CLI (Command-Line Interface):** Provides a simple interface for interacting with the system, allowing users to perform actions like adding new animals, assigning tasks to employees, and viewing animal and employee details.

---

**This project serves as a powerful tool for zoo management, ensuring efficient operations and providing an intuitive way to handle both animal and employee data.**
